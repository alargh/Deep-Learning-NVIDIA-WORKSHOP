# README - Fundamentals of Deep Learning Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my assessment submission and the certificate I earned upon successfully completing the **Fundamentals of Deep Learning** course offered by NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute (DLI).

## About the Course
The **Fundamentals of Deep Learning** course provides hands-on training in deep learning techniques and frameworks. The workshop covers essential deep learning concepts, including:
- Training deep neural networks for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP)
- Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification
- Applying data augmentation techniques to improve model performance
- Leveraging transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained models
- Building and evaluating models using TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and NumPy

### Workshop Highlights
Participants worked with real-world datasets, trained models from scratch, and optimized deep learning pipelines using GPU-accelerated computing resources. The final assessment involved training a model to classify fresh and rotten fruits.

## About My Assessment
For my final assessment, I trained a deep learning model to classify images of fresh and rotten fruits. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of six categories:
- **Fresh Apples**
- **Fresh Oranges**
- **Fresh Bananas**
- **Rotten Apples**
- **Rotten Oranges**
- **Rotten Bananas**

### Model Architecture & Training Details
- **Neural Network Structure:**
  - Input layer for image data
  - Convolutional layers with activation functions
  - Fully connected layers with ReLU activations
  - Output layer with six neurons (one for each category)
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Adam
- **Evaluation Metric:** Model accuracy on validation data

### Key Learnings & Takeaways
- Improved dataset efficiency through data augmentation
- Utilized transfer learning to enhance model accuracy with minimal computation
- Understood the impact of hyperparameters on model performance
- Successfully classified fruit images with high accuracy
